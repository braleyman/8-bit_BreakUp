# 8-bit_BreakUp
6502 machine language game for apple ii

this game will be a breakout clone. It started with just a simple dot that bounces around on the screen. 

I really wanted a debugger to help during development, so I'm currently building my own. Why did they remove the STEP and TRACE functionality from the Apple ii ROM??? 

The files for the debugger are also in the directory. No, I do not want to use an existing apple ii debugger, like Bug Byter. I'd rather go through the process myself and maybe learn a thing or two on the way.

Once the debugger is complete, I'll use it to help continue developing the game.

The code is being written using the VSC IDE and Peter Tihanyi's Retro Assembler.
