# 8-bit_BreakUp
6502 machine language game for apple ii

this game will be a breakout clone. It started with just a simple dot that bounces around on the screen. 

I really wanted a debugger to help during development, so I'm currently building my own. The files for the debugger are also in the directory.

Once the debugger is complete, I'll incorporate it with the game and get back on course.
